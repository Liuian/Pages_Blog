Time complexity
Average Time Complexity of HashMap = O(1)
Average Case:
Insertion (average): O(1)
Lookup (average): O(1)
Deletion (average): O(1)

Worst Case:
Insertion (worst): O(n), where n is the size of the hash map. This occurs when there are many hash collisions, leading to linear probing or other collision resolution strategies that may involve traversing the entire hash map.
Lookup and Deletion (worst): O(n), for the same reason as insertion.

A hash table or hash map, is a data structure that helps with mapping keys to values for highly efficient operations…www.freecodecamp.org
Time Complexity of HashMap get is O(1). Why?
在最近的一次面試中，面試人員問我HashMap的時間複雜度。我很快地回答他是O(1)，但他又問我為什麼是O(1)呢？我發現我答不出來。medium.com
sort()
In the worst case, Timsort takes O(nlogn).
Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language.
