## ðŸ§¾ Problem Description  
> Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

> The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

- Example:
    - ![alt text](image.png)
- Example 1
    - Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8; Output: 5

- Example 2
    - Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4; Output: 3
    - Explanation: The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant of itself.

- Constraints:
    - 2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
    - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    - p != q
    - p and q will both exist in the BST.

- Recommended Time & Space Complexity
    - You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(h) time and O(h) space, where h is the height of the given tree.

> Hint 1: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which the values of all nodes in the left subtree of a node are less than the node's value, and the values of all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node's value. Additionally, every subtree of a BST must also satisfy this property, meaning the "less than" or "greater than" condition is valid for all nodes in the tree, not just the root. How can you use this idea to find the LCA of the given nodes in the tree?

> Hint 2: We can use recursion to traverse the tree. Can you figure out the conditions we encounter when choosing a path between the left and right subtrees during traversal using the values of the two given nodes? Perhaps you can determine the LCA by traversing based on these conditions.

> Hint 3: If nodes p and q are in different subtrees, a split occurs, making the current node the LCA. If both are in the left or right subtree, the LCA lies in that subtree and we further choose that subtree to traverse using recursion. You should also handle other multiple scenarios to get the LCA.

> Hint 4: The LCA can also be one of the nodes, p or q, if the current node is equal to either of them. This is because if we encounter either p or q during the traversal, that node is the LCA.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def build_tree_from_list(data):
        if not data or data[0] is None:
            return None
        
        nodes = []
        for val in data:
            if val is not None:
                nodes.append(TreeNode(val))
            else:
                nodes.append(None)

        for i in range(len(data)):
            if nodes[i]:
                left_index = 2 * i + 1
                right_index = 2 * i + 2
                if left_index < len(data):
                    nodes[i].left = nodes[left_index]
                if right_index < len(data):
                    nodes[i].right = nodes[right_index]
        
        return nodes[0]

    # Find p and q and record path(ancestors) in the mean time
    def find_path(node, target, path):
        if not node:
            return False
        
        path.append(node)

        if node == target:
            return True

        if find_path(node.left, target, path) or find_path(node.right, target, path):
            return True
        
        path.pop()

        return False


    def lowest_common_ancestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        path_p = [] # Find p and record path(ancestors) in the mean time
        path_q = [] # Find q and record path(ancestors) in the mean time
        find_path(root, p, path_p)
        find_path(root, q, path_q)
