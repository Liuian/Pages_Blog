# About Me

Hi, I'm Ian!  
I'm currently preparing to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science at Utrecht University.  
I completed my bachelor's degree at **National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)** through the **College of Computer Engineering and Programming (CCEP)**, with a double specialization in **Information and Computer Science** and **Statistics**.

This blog is where I share:

- Tool tutorials (e.g., GitHub Pages, VSCode, Pyodide)
- Notes from computer science and data science studies
- Reflections on books, research, and everyday thoughts

Feel free to explore, or reach out to me on GitHub!
